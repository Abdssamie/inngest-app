    *   Search for "Software Developer" or "Software Engineer" with the location set to "Morocco."
    *   Connect with developers and share the project's vision.
    *   Join and post in Moroccan tech groups on LinkedIn.
*   **Facebook Groups:**
    *   Search for and join groups like "Moroccan Programmers," "Devoxx Morocco Community," and other local tech communities.
    *   Post about the project and invite contributors.

    *   List the project on the platform.
    *   Specify that you are looking for contributors from Morocco.

### 2. Local Tech Hubs and Communities

### 5. Making the Project Attractive to Contributors

*   **Bilingual Documentation:**
    *   Translate the `README.md` and contribution guides into French.
*   **Clear Contribution Path:**
    *   Create "good first issues" that are well-documented and easy for newcomers.
    *   Maintain the simplified JSON-based action creation process.

    *   Clearly communicate the project's vision and market potential.
    *   Emphasize that it is a Moroccan-led project solving real-world business problems.
