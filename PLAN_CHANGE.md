# Workflow Agency Platform - Knowledge Summary

## 1. Platform Overview
- Your platform is **not a SaaS product**, but an **automation agency offering prebuilt workflows** for client needs.
- Clients provide **credentials only**; they do **not build or edit workflows**.
- Focus: **secure, scalable, multi-user workflow execution**, reliable scheduling, and client delivery.

## 2. Tool Selection & Roles

| Tool        | Role                                                                                 |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Inngest** | Event-driven workflow engine. Handles cron jobs, triggers, retries, and durable execution. |
| **Langflow** | Executes prebuilt workflows with **multi-user credential isolation**. Maintains flow metadata, environment variables, and reusable workflow logic. |
| **Postgres DB** | Stores flow metadata, user preferences, credential references. Scalable and production-ready. |
| **External Storage** | Stores workflow outputs, logs, analytics, large files/datasets. |

---

## 3. Langflow Insights
- Multi-user mode (`LANGFLOW_AUTO_LOGIN=False`) allows **user isolation**.
- Supports **credential storage and environment variables**.
- Does **not provide enterprise-grade multi-tenancy** (no separate DB per client, custom domains, billing).
- Ideal for your use case: users only provide credentials, workflows are prebuilt by you.
- Default nodes are **AI-focused**, but you can **add custom business nodes** (email, API calls, DB operations, file handling).

---

## 4. Database Considerations
- **SQLite** is used by default; **not suitable for production**.
- **Postgres is recommended**:
  - Supports concurrency, scalability, reliability.
  - Allows JSONB fields for workflow configs and metadata.
- Langflow DB should **only store flows, credentials, and preferences**.
- Actual user data (logs, files, workflow outputs) should go to **external scalable storage**.

---

## 5. Scheduling & Triggers
- Langflow doesn’t natively support cron jobs; can be integrated with:
  - **Server cron jobs**
  - **Celery or APScheduler**
  - **Inngest** (recommended for durable execution)
- Webhooks are supported via **FastAPI endpoints** or custom nodes.

---

## 6. Integration Strategy (Recommended)
- **Inngest** → schedules and triggers workflows reliably.
- **Langflow** → executes workflows securely with isolated credentials.
- **Frontend website** → handles:
  - Credential input
  - Workflow activation
  - Documentation / guides
  - Optional dashboard for status/logs
- **External DB/Storage** → stores outputs, logs, and large user data.

---

## 7. Business Node Considerations
- Langflow default nodes do **not include basic business actions** like “Send Email”.
- Need to implement **custom nodes** for:
  - Email (SMTP, Gmail, etc.)
  - HTTP requests / API integrations
  - Database CRUD operations
  - File handling
  - Notifications

## 9. Key Takeaways
- Trying to code all workflows and integrations manually in Inngest is **inefficient and risky**, especially as a solo founder.
- Combining **Inngest + Langflow** gives:
  - Reliable execution
  - Multi-user credential isolation
  - Prebuilt workflow logic
  - Scalability for enterprise clients
- Your focus should be on **workflow design, credential handling, and client delivery**, not rebuilding workflow engines.
- Moving from solo to hiring developers will be easier with this architecture.

---

## 10. Next Steps
1. Migrate Langflow from SQLite → Postgres for production readiness.
2. Build **custom business nodes** (email, API, DB, file ops).
3. Connect **Inngest triggers → Langflow workflows**.
4. Create **frontend portal** for credential input and workflow activation.
5. Use **external storage/DB** for workflow outputs and logs.
6. Implement **monitoring and error handling** for enterprise reliability.
7. Document prebuilt workflows for client onboarding.

---

## ✅ Summary
You now have a **clear, production-ready plan** for a scalable, enterprise-level workflow agency platform:
- Clients provide credentials → workflows executed in Langflow → Inngest handles scheduling/events → outputs stored safely.
- Fully ready to scale from **solo founder** to **multi-developer team**.
